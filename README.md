## Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
<hr>

I've made it a priority to study AI and ML and apply it as needed to my work and personal projects. I've shared this knowledge and experience with other, so they too can take their AI/ML skills to the next level.

<br>

### AI/ML Learning Labs I've authored:

- [Machine Learning for Network Engineers: Part 1](https://developer.cisco.com/learning/labs/ml-for-network-engineers-part-1/) - wildly successful foundational lab and the first of it's kind at Cisco


<br>

### AI/ML Articles and Blogs I've authored:

- [Exploring Cisco's Machine Learning-Enhanced Solutions](https://community.cisco.com/t5/devnet-general-blogs/exploring-cisco-s-machine-learning-enhanced-solutions/ba-p/5145655)

- [Artificial Intelligence (AI) at the Edge](https://community.cisco.com/t5/edge-data-management/artificial-intelligence-ai-at-the-edge/td-p/4674085)

### DevOps Repos

- [meeting-agenda-and-recap](https://github.com/xanderstevenson/meeting-agenda-and-recap) - Automates the posting of meeting agendas and recaps in Webex spaces. It also keep records of the agendas and recaps sent. Written in Python.

- [simple-netdevops-ci](https://github.com/xanderstevenson/simple-netdevops-ci) - This is a simple and free CI pipeline that receives a webhook from GitHub whenever anything changes in the GitHub repo. The webhook triggers a build action in Jenkins that runs a shell that clones the GitHub repo and creates a virtual environment to run pytests. Currently, the repo I am cloning from is based on Ansible, so my tests are for Ansible playbooks and inventory files, but those can be adapted to test whatever you want. If a pytest fails, a message with details is sent to a Webex space and the build fails as well.

- [intro-ansible-automation](https://github.com/xanderstevenson/intro-ansible-automation) - Automate the creation of ACLs, routing reports, and local files, and more using variables and conditionals in Ansible playbooks. Presented at multiple Cisco Lives.

- [word-of-the-day](https://github.com/xanderstevenson/word-of-the-day) - A Webex bot, written in Python, which sends a random tech word to a Webex Space and to LinkedIn daily, using APIs. Anyone can join the space: https://eurl.io/#3wNrmU0-1

- [diy-devops-dashboard](https://github.com/xanderstevenson/diy-devops-dashboard) - I made this project as a way for those new to DevOps to get started with the basic technologies involved (GitHub, Docker, GitLab, Jenkins, Terraform, Elasticsearch). It provides the user with an all-in-one place to see their progress and to better understand how these different tools interact in the DevOps lifecycle. This project runs a Flask App, which serves the web dashboard. It is written in Python and most of the data is collected via external API calls, with Docker and Jenkins data being collected straight from your machine. Besides displaying all your DevOps data neatly organized in the dashboard, you can send the data to a Webex space via message by clicking the 'Post to Webex' button in the menu.

- [swiss-army-conf](https://github.com/xanderstevenson/swiss-army-conf) - Written in Python, this tool offers those monitoring a network device with 3 avenues for viewing device configuration: NETCONF, RESTCONF and SSH. The results are automatically logged in XML, JSON and text formats, respectively.

- [community-content-pipeline](https://github.com/xanderstevenson/community-content-pipeline) - The continuous integration pipeline creates a new project folder based on a .docx file name and will automatically convert the .docx to a downloadable MP3, saving it in an 'mp3s' sub-folder in your new project. All URLs and empty lines will have been removed, to give your audio a smooth, consistent flow. It also allows you some control over which spoken accent the MP3 will use. The final result is a text source of truth (.docx, .txt and MP3) for your blog or article.

- [txt_2_mp3](https://github.com/xanderstevenson/txt_2_mp3) - a limited subset of the above repo, it is a Python program to convert a .txt file, in English, into an MP3 audio file, with choice of English language accent

- [ciscolodex](https://github.com/xanderstevenson/ciscolodex) - a  offline tool written in Python and Tkinter which I used to provide basic answers to customer inquiries regarding DevNet, specifically the DevNet Associate Fundamentals Course.

- [predictionary]() - This app, written in Python and with a Jupyter Notebook, prompts for a first name and uses that, along with your IP address and other info to guess your actual sex, age, and location.
