<h2>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning</h2>
<hr>

<p>I've made it a priority to study AI and ML and apply it as needed to my work and personal projects. I've shared this knowledge and experience with others, so they too can take their AI/ML skills to the next level.</p>

<br>

<h3>AI/ML Learning Labs I've authored:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/learning/labs/ml-for-network-engineers-part-1/">Machine Learning for Network Engineers: Part 1</a> - wildly successful foundational lab and the first of its kind at Cisco. This Learning Lab introduces the foundational concepts of machine learning (ML) in a format suitable for network engineers and others who are new to the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and ML and who are interested in experimenting and learning how to apply ML techniques to improve their performance.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>AI/ML Videos I've created:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="https://youtu.be/jyvmkXj2o-8">Transforming DevOps with AI and ML: Innovations and Strategies</a> - Part of the DevOps Shop series on YouTube. In this video, we explore the transformative impact of integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) with DevOps. We delve into how these technologies enhance automation, efficiency, and decision-making in software development and IT operations. We also examine the evolution of specialized hardware, address key challenges in AI/ML integration, and look at how Cisco utilizes these technologies to enhance its products. By the end, you'll better understand the current trends and future directions in this dynamic field.

<h3>Artificial Intelligence Groups I'm a member of:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>BridgeIT Insights Group</strong> - at Cisco DevNet. BridgeIT is DevNet's internal AI for employee use and I help oversee its development and progress.</li>
    <li><strong>DevNet AI Tiger Team</strong> - also at DevNet. This team is the cutting-edge leadership group guiding decision-making in all things AI/ML related.</li>

<h3>DevOps Projects I've created:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong><a href="https://github.com/xanderstevenson/meeting-agenda-and-recap">meeting-agenda-and-recap</a></strong> - Automates the posting of meeting agendas and recaps in Webex spaces. It also keeps records of the agendas and recaps sent. Written in Python.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong><a href="https://github.com/xanderstevenson/simple-netdevops-ci">simple-netdevops-ci</a></strong> - This is a simple and free CI pipeline that receives a webhook from GitHub whenever anything changes in the GitHub repo. The webhook triggers a build action in Jenkins that runs a shell that clones the GitHub repo and creates a virtual environment to run pytests. Currently, the repo I am cloning from is based on Ansible, so my tests are for Ansible playbooks and inventory files, but those can be adapted to test whatever you want. If a pytest fails, a message with details is sent to a Webex space and the build fails as well.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong><a href="https://github.com/xanderstevenson/intro-ansible-automation">intro-ansible-automation</a></strong> - Automate the creation of ACLs, routing reports, and local files, and more using variables and conditionals in Ansible playbooks. Presented at multiple Cisco Lives.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong><a href="https://github.com/xanderstevenson/word-of-the-day">word-of-the-day</a></strong> - A Webex bot, written in Python, which sends a random tech word to a Webex Space and to LinkedIn daily, using APIs. Anyone can join the space: <a href="https://eurl.io/#3wNrmU0-1">https://eurl.io/#3wNrmU0-1</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong><a href="https://github.com/xanderstevenson/diy-devops-dashboard">diy-devops-dashboard</a></strong> - I made this project as a way for those new to DevOps to get started with the basic technologies involved (GitHub, Docker, GitLab, Jenkins, Terraform, Elasticsearch). It provides the user with an all-in-one place to see their progress and to better understand how these different tools interact in the DevOps
